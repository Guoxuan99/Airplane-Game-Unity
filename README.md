# Airplane-Game-Unity
2021/2022 sem 1 - AI Game Individual Assignment Project - Airplane Game - A Unity game project that user will need to control the airplane in order to fly through obstacles.


This is my first project on Unity and it is fun to manipulate the 3D objects in the game, adding collider, rigid body, as well as C# script for the object to move as desired. This is a very interesting project and there are a lot more to learn about Unity. This project is just a scratch on the surface.


This is how the interface look like, user will have to control the airplane to let it move through the obstacles by up and down key
